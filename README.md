VUSA -- the Very Unreliable Speech Assistant
============================================

**This tiny thing is available to play at [https://vusa.surge.sh](https://vusa.surge.sh)**

Just a tiny little script having fun with the [WebSpeech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).

Commands & Keywords you can use or try:

* Open 'site'
* hello
* how are you
* who are you
* where are you from
* secret

Have a play around while I put a few APIS (weather, news, trending tweets) in.

More to come... I'm just playing around to be honest. Fork/contribute/have fun! ðŸ˜Š
