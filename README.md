VUSA -- the Very Unreliable Speech Assistant
====================================

Voice recognition now works. Assistant part being put in. Have a play around!

Just a tiny little script having fun with the [WebSpeech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).

Commands & Keywords you can use or try:

* Weather
* Hello
* vusa
* open facebook/twitter/google/github

More to come... I'm just playing around to be honest. Fork/contribute/have fun! ðŸ˜Š
